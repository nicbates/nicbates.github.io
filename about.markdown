Having started my career as a Phyiscs teacher & Osteopath, I was priveledge enough to be able take a career break for parental leave in order to give my children the best start in life that they could have - realising how important that this early time is in a childs development. During this time I studied for a Masters in Computer Science and Big Data Analytics - realising how important data has become to our society & almost every industry.

As both my children have now out-grew this need I have returned to the work environment to progress in a career based in data its analysis and the use of the ever evolving field of AI and machine learning.
