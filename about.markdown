I started my career as a Secondary School teacher of Physics and Mathematics, quickly rising to Head of Physics. I took the department through an Ofsted school inspection resulting in an Outstanding school rating. My lifelong love of learning something new led me to look at new ways to use my skills, and I returned to university on a part time basis, becoming qualified as an Osteopath. I used these skills to continue teaching others – this time tutoring Sports Massage courses, alongside running my own clinic as an Osteopath. I was able to use all of my analytical skills to understand the right treatment for patients, assessing risk and listening with empathy.

Once I had children, I took part time roles to take a more active role in their development and childcare. As they grew, I wanted to take my analysis skills further and continue learning, by taking on a part time Masters degree in Computer Science and Big Data Analysis and since graduating with my distinction I have continued self-development and keeping my skills fresh by completing self-directed learning online. I am looking to develop my career in an analytical or data focussed role.
